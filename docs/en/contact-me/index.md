If you encounter any problems during use, you can join the QQ group by scanning the QR code or add my WeChat. I will answer for you as soon as possible. Not only limited to `directives-expand` issues, other problems can also be communicated together.

> If the QQ group QR code is invalid, please add my WeChat, and I will pull you into the group.
