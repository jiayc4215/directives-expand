## What is directives-expand?

directives-expand is a Vue3 custom directive extension library designed to provide a series of commonly used and optimized directives, helping developers handle common interaction logic more efficiently, such as one-click copying, debouncing, throttling, etc.

## Features

- 🚀 **Easy to Use** - Minimalist API design, ready to use out of the box
- 📦 **Lightweight** - Tiny bundle size, almost no impact on project performance
- 🎨 **Feature Rich** - Covers most directive scenarios needed in business development

## Why choose directives-expand?

While Vue3 provides powerful custom directive functionality, in actual development, we often need to repeatedly write some common directive logic (such as copying to clipboard, debounce processing, etc.). directives-expand encapsulates these common logics into directives, allowing you to:

1. **Reduce Boilerplate Code** - No longer need to repeatedly write the same directive code in every component or project
2. **More Robust Implementation** - The internal implementation handles various edge cases and compatibility issues (such as clipboard API fallback)
3. **Clearer Semantics** - Express complex interaction intentions through simple directives
